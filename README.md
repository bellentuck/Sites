# Sites
Ya know... "web" sites


Right now stuff is scattered between here and DH-demos, but I hope to combine in a coherent way. Perhaps eventually 'Sites' will be RoR-centric and 'DH-demos' will be more Jupyter-centric.

...the eventual idea being to have...

- repo for WP themes and plugins: TLM, 18cC(?), misc

- repo for Rulers of Venice

- repo for Sitcom Reader

- SEO repo?: 18cC (best practices user's guide) - qua "DH Cookbook"
