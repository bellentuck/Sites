The man looks \r\nat the sky through the window-panes and sees ... \r\n\r\nA light cloud moving toward the full moon.\r\n\r\nThen a young woman\'s head, her eyes wide open. A razor blade \r\nmoves toward one of the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe light cloud passes now across the moon.\r\n \r\nThe razor blade cuts through the eye of the young woman, \r\nslicing it.\r\n\r\n				End of Prologue.\r\n \r\n\r\nEIGHT YEARS LATER\r\n\r\n\r\nA deserted street. It is raining.\r\n\r\nA character dressed in a dark-gray suit appears riding a \r\nbicycle. His head, back and loins are adorned in ruffles of \r\nwhite linen. A rectangular box with black and white diagonal \r\nstripes is secured to his chest by straps. The character \r\npedals mechanically without holding the handlebars, with his \r\nhands resting on his knees. \r\n\r\nThe character is seen from the back down to the thighs in a \r\nmedium shot, superimposed lengthwise on the street down \r\nwhich he is cycling with his back to the camera.\r\n\r\nThe character moves toward the camera until the striped box \r\nis seen in a close-up.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary room on the third floor on the same street. A \r\nyoung girl wearing a brightly colored dress is sitting in \r\nthe middle of the room attentively reading a book. Suddenly \r\nshe comes out of her reading with a start, listens with \r\ncuriosity, freeing herself of the book by throwing it on a \r\nnearby couch. The book stays open with a reproduction of \r\nVermeer\'s The Lacemaker on one of the pages facing \r\nup. The young woman is convinced now that something is in \r\nthe offing: she, gets up, and, half turning, walks in quick \r\nsteps toward the window. \r\n\r\nThe character we have mentioned before has just at this very \r\nmoment stopped, below on the street. Without offering the \r\nleast resistance, out of inertia, he lets himself come down \r\nwith the bicycle into the gutter, in the midst of a mud \r\nheap.\r\n\r\nLooking enraged and resentful, the young woman hurries down \r\nthe stairs and out to the street.\r\n\r\nClose-up of the character sprawling on the ground, \r\nexpressionless, his position identical to that at the \r\nmoment of his fall.\r\n\r\nThe young woman comes out of the house, and, throwing \r\nherself on the cyclist, she frantically kisses him on the \r\nmouth, the eyes and the nose. The rain gets heavier to the \r\nextent of blotting out the preceding scene. \r\n\r\nDissolve to the box whose diagonal stripes are superimposed \r\non those of the rain. Hands equipped with a little key open \r\nthe box, pulling out a tie wrapped in tissue paper. It must \r\nbe taken into account that the rain, the box, the tissue \r\npaper and the tie should all exhibit these diagonal stripes, \r\nwith their sizes alone varying. \r\n\r\nThe same room.\r\n\r\nStanding by the bed, the young woman is looking at the \r\nclothing articles that had been worn by the character -- \r\nruffles, box, and the stiff collar with the plain dark tie \r\n-- all laid out as though they were worn by a person lying \r\non the bed. The young woman finally decides to pick up the \r\ncollar, removing the plain tie in order to replace it with \r\nthe striped one which she has just taken out of the box. \r\nShe puts it back in the same place, and then sits down by \r\nthe bed in the posture of a person watching over the dead.\r\n\r\n(Note: The bed, that is to say, the bedspread and the \r\npillow, are slightly rumpled and depressed as if a human \r\nbody were really lying there).\r\n\r\nThe woman is aware that someone is standing behind her and \r\nturns around to see who it is. Without the least surprise, \r\nshe sees the character who now is without any of his former \r\naccessory articles, looking very attentively at something \r\nin his right hand. His great absorption betrays quite a \r\ngreat deal of anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe woman approaches and looks in turn at what he has in his \r\nhand. Close-up of the hand, the middle of which is teeming \r\nwith ants swarming out of a black hole. None of these falls \r\noff.\r\n\r\nDissolve to the armpit hair of a young woman sprawled on \r\nthe sand of a sunny beach. Dissolve to a sea urchin whose \r\nspines ripple slightly. Dissolve to the head of another \r\nyoung woman in a powerful overhead shot framed by an iris. \r\nThe iris opens to reveal the young woman surrounded by a \r\nthrong of people who are trying to break through a police \r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this circle, the young woman, holding a \r\nstick, attempts to pick up a severed hand with painted \r\nfingernails that is lying on the ground. A policeman comes \r\nup to her, sharply reprimanding her; he bends down and \r\npicks up the hand which he carefully wraps up and puts in \r\nthe box that was carried by the cyclist. He hands it all to \r\nthe young woman, saluting her in a military fashion while \r\nshe thanks him. \r\n\r\nAs the policeman hands her the box, she must appear to be \r\ncarried away by an extraordinary emotion that isolates her \r\ncompletely from everything around her. It is as though she \r\nwere enthralled by the echoes of distant religious music; \r\nperhaps music she heard in her earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nTheir curiosity satisfied, the bystanders begin to disperse \r\nin all directions.\r\n\r\nThis scene will have been seen by the characters whom we \r\nhave left in the room on the third floor. They are seen \r\nthrough the window panes of the balcony from which may be \r\nseen the end of the scene described above. When the \r\npoliceman hands the box over to the young woman, the two \r\ncharacters on the balcony appear to also be overcome to \r\nthe point of tears by the same emotion. Their heads sway \r\nas though following the rhythm of this impalpable music. \r\n\r\nThe man looks at the young woman and makes a gesture as \r\nthough he were saying: \"Did you see? Hadn\'t I told you so?\" \r\nShe looks down again at the young woman on the street who \r\nis now all alone and, as if pinned down to the spot, in a \r\nstate of utter restraint. Cars pass all around her at \r\nbreathtaking speeds. Suddenly she is run over by one of the \r\ncars and is left there horribly mutilated.\r\n\r\nIt is then that, with the decisiveness of a man fully \r\nknowing his rights, the man goes over to his companion, and, \r\nhaving gazed lasciviously straight into her eyes, he grabs \r\nher breasts through her dress. Closeup of the lustful hands \r\nover the breasts. These are bared as the dress disappears. \r\nA terrible expression of almost mortal anguish spreads over \r\nthe man\'s face, and a blood-streaked dribble runs out of \r\nhis mouth dripping on the young woman\'s bare breasts.\r\n\r\nThe breasts disappear to be transformed into thighs which \r\nthe man continues to palpate. His expression has changed. \r\nHis eyes sparkle with malice and lust. His wide open mouth \r\nnow closes down as if tightened up by a sphincter.\r\n\r\nThe young woman moves back toward the middle of the room, \r\nfollowed by the man who is still in the same posture.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she makes a forceful motion, breaking his hold on \r\nher, freeing herself from his amorous advances. \r\n\r\nThe man\'s mouth tightens with anger.\r\n\r\nShe realizes that a disagreeable or violent scene is about \r\nto take place. She moves back, step by step, until she \r\nreaches the corner of the room, where she takes up a \r\nposition behind a small table.\r\n \r\nAssuming the gestures of the melodrama villain, the man \r\nlooks around for something or other. He sees at his feet the \r\nend of a rope and picks it up with his right hand. His left \r\nhand gropes about too and gets hold of an identical rope.\r\n\r\nGlued to the wall the young woman watches with horror her \r\nattacker\'s stratagem.\r\n\r\nThe latter advances toward her dragging with great effort \r\nthat which is attached behind to the ropes.\r\n\r\nWe see passing before our eyes on the screen: first, a cork, \r\nthen a melon, then two Brothers of Christian Schools, and \r\nfinally two magnificent grand pianos. The pianos are loaded \r\nwith the rotting carcasses of two donkeys, their feet, \r\ntails, hindquarters and excrement spilling out of the \r\npiano-cases. As one of the pianos passes in front of the \r\ncamera lens, a large donkey\'s head is seen pressing the \r\nkeyboard.\r\n\r\nPulling with great difficulty this burden, the man \r\ndesperately strains toward the young woman, knocking over \r\nchairs, tables, a floor lamp, etc., etc. The donkey\'s \r\nhind-quarters get caught in everything. A lamp hanging from \r\nthe ceiling is jostled by a stripped bone, and continues \r\nrocking until the end of the scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the man is about to reach the young woman, she dodges \r\nhim with a leap and escapes. Her attacker lets go of the \r\nropes and begins pursuing her. The young woman opens a \r\ncommunicating door and vanishes into the next room, but not \r\nquickly enough to be able to lock the door behind her. The \r\nman\'s hand having made it past the joint, is held captive, \r\ncaught at the wrist.\r\n\r\nInside the other room, pressing the door harder and harder, \r\nthe young woman looks at the hand which wrenches in pain in \r\nslow motion as the ants reappear and swarm over the door.\r\n\r\nRight away, she turns her head toward the middle of the new \r\nroom, which is identical to the previous one, but on which \r\nthe lighting confers a different look; the young woman \r\nsees ...\r\n\r\nA man sprawled on the bed who is the one and the same man \r\nwhose hand is still caught in the door. Wearing the ruffles \r\nwith the box resting on his chest he does not make the \r\nleast movement but lies there, his eyes wide open, his \r\nsuperstitious expression seeming to say: \"Something really\r\nextraordinary is now about to happen!\"\r\n \r\n\r\nABOUT THREE O\'CLOCK IN THE MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\nA new character is seen from the back on the landing; he \r\nhas just stopped by the entrance door to the apartment. He \r\nrings the bell of the apartment where the events are taking \r\nplace. We don\'t see the bell nor the electric hammer, but \r\nin their place, over the door, there are two holes through \r\nwhich pass two hands shaking a silver cocktail shaker. \r\nTheir action is instantaneous, as in ordinary films when a \r\ndoorbell button is being pressed.\r\n\r\nThe man lying on the bed gives a start. \r\n\r\nThe young woman goes and opens the door.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes directly to the bed and imperiously \r\norders the man to get up. The man complies so grudgingly \r\nthat the other is obliged to grab him by the ruffles and \r\nforce him to his feet.\r\n\r\nHaving torn off the ruffles one by one, the newcomer throws \r\nthem out of the window. The box follows the same route and \r\nso do the straps which the man tries in vain to save from \r\nthe catastrophe. And this leads the newcomer to punish the \r\nman by making him go and stand with his face to one of the \r\nwalls. \r\n\r\nThe newcomer will have done all this with his back \r\ncompletely turned to the camera. He turns around now for \r\nthe first time in order to go and look for something on the \r\nother side of the room. \r\n\r\nThe sub-title says:\r\n \r\n\r\nSIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE\r\n\r\n \r\nAt this point the photography becomes hazy. The newcomer \r\nmoves in slow motion and we set that his features are \r\nidentical to those of the other; they are one and the same \r\nperson, but for the fact that the newcomer looks younger \r\nand more doleful, as the other must have been years before.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes toward the back of the room with the \r\ncamera tracking back and keeping him in medium close-up.\r\n\r\nThe school desk toward which our individual is heading \r\nenters the frame. There are two books on the school desk, \r\nas well as various school objects, whose position and moral \r\nmeaning are to be carefully determined.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer picks up the two books and turns to go and \r\njoin the other man. At this point everything goes back to \r\nnormal, the fuzziness and slow motion having disappeared.\r\n\r\nHaving come up to the man, the newcomer directs him to hold \r\nout his arms in a cruciform position, places a book in each \r\nhand, and orders him to remain so as a punishment.\r\n\r\nThe punished character\'s expression has now become keen and \r\ntreacherous. He turns to face the newcomer. The books he \r\nhas been holding turn into revolvers.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer looks at him with tenderness, an expression \r\nthat becomes more pronounced with each passing moment.\r\n\r\nThe other, threatening the newcomer with his guns and \r\nforcing him to put his hands up, does not heed the latter\'s \r\ncompliance and fires both revolvers at him. Medium close-up \r\nof the newcomer falling down fatally wounded, his features \r\ncontorted in agony (the photography\'s fuzziness is resumed \r\nand the newcomer\'s fall is in slow motion, in a way that is \r\nmore pronounced than previously).\r\n\r\nWe see in the distance the wounded man falling; this, \r\nhowever, happens no longer inside the room but in a park. \r\nSeated next to him is a motionless woman with bare \r\nshoulders, who is seen from behind leaning slightly forward. \r\nAs he falls the wounded man attempts to seize and stroke her \r\nshoulders; one of his hands is turned shaking toward \r\nhimself; the other brushes against the skin of the naked \r\nshoulders. Finally he falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nView from afar. A few passers-by and several park-keepers \r\nrush over to help. They pick him up in their arms and bear \r\nhim away through the woods.\r\n\r\nLet the passionate lame man play a role here.\r\n    \r\nAnd we are back at the same room. A door, the one in which \r\nthe hand had been caught, now opens slowly. The young woman \r\nwe already know appears. She closes the door behind her and \r\nstares very attentively at the wall against which the \r\nmurderer had stood.\r\n\r\nThe man is no longer there. The wall is bare, without any \r\nfurniture or decoration. The young woman makes a gesture of \r\nvexation and impatience.\r\n\r\nThe wall is seen again; in the middle of it there is a small \r\nblack spot. \r\n\r\nSeen much closer, this small spot appears to be a \r\ndeath\'s-head moth. \r\n\r\nClose-up of the moth.\r\n\r\nThe death\'s head on the moth\'s wings fills the whole screen. \r\n\r\nThe man who was wearing ruffles comes suddenly into view in \r\na medium shot bringing his hand swiftly to his mouth as \r\nthough he were losing his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe young woman looks at him disdainfully.\r\n    \r\nWhen the man takes away his hand, we see that his mouth has \r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe young woman seems to be saying to him: \"Well, and what \r\nnext?\" and then she touches up her lips with a lipstick.\r\n\r\nWe see again the man\'s head. Hair begins to sprout where \r\nhis mouth had been.\r\n\r\nHaving caught sight of this, the young woman stifles a cry \r\nand swiftly examines her armpit which is completely \r\ndepilated. She scornfully sticks out her tongue at him, \r\nthrows a shawl over her shoulders, and, opening the door \r\nnear her, goes into the adjacent room which is a wide \r\nbeach. \r\n\r\nA third character is waiting for her near the water\'s edge. \r\nThey greet each other very amiably, and meander together \r\ndown the waterline.\r\n \r\nA shot of their legs and the waves breaking at their feet. \r\n\r\nThe camera follows them in a dolly shot. The waves gently \r\nwash ashore at their feet, first, the straps, then the \r\nstriped box followed by the ruffles, and finally the \r\nbicycle. This shot continues a moment longer without \r\nanything else being washed ashore.\r\n\r\nThey continue their walk on the beach, little by little \r\nfading from view, while in the sky appear the words:\r\n \r\n\r\nIN THE SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything has changed.\r\n\r\nWe see now a desert without end. We see the man and the \r\nyoung woman in the center, sunk in sand up to their chests, \r\nblinded, their clothes in tatters, devoured by the sun and \r\nby swarms of insects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Shooting Script by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí \r\nTranslated by Haim Finkelstein\r\n','2016-11-29 21:36:36','2016-12-20 19:46:45','robin-means-coleman-the-hidden-truths-in-contemporary-black-sitcoms','Author Interviews'),(11,'https://vimeo.com/163469787/f6d47486ce','Judy Kutulas: Liberated Women and New Sensitive Men: Reconstructing Gender in 1970s Workplace Comedies','','PROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce Upon a Time ... \r\n\r\n\r\nA balcony at night.\r\n\r\nA man is sharpening a razor by the balcony.

It is raining.\r\n\r\nA character dressed in a dark-gray suit appears riding a \r\nbicycle. His head, back and loins are adorned in ruffles of \r\nwhite linen. A rectangular box with black and white diagonal \r\nstripes is secured to his chest by straps. The character \r\npedals mechanically without holding the handlebars, with his \r\nhands resting on his knees. \r\n\r\nThe character is seen from the back down to the thighs in a \r\nmedium shot, superimposed lengthwise on the street down \r\nwhich he is cycling with his back to the camera.\r\n\r\nThe character moves toward the camera until the striped box \r\nis seen in a close-up.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary room on the third floor on the same street. A \r\nyoung girl wearing a brightly colored dress is sitting in \r\nthe middle of the room attentively reading a book. Suddenly \r\nshe comes out of her reading with a start, listens with \r\ncuriosity, freeing herself of the book by throwing it on a \r\nnearby couch. The book stays open with a reproduction of \r\nVermeer\'s The Lacemaker on one of the pages facing \r\nup. The young woman is convinced now that something is in \r\nthe offing: she, gets up, and, half turning, walks in quick \r\nsteps toward the window. \r\n\r\nThe character we have mentioned before has just at this very \r\nmoment stopped, below on the street. Without offering the \r\nleast resistance, out of inertia, he lets himself come down \r\nwith the bicycle into the gutter, in the midst of a mud \r\nheap.\r\n\r\nLooking enraged and resentful, the young woman hurries down \r\nthe stairs and out to the street.\r\n\r\nClose-up of the character sprawling on the ground, \r\nexpressionless, his position identical to that at the \r\nmoment of his fall.\r\n\r\nThe young woman comes out of the house, and, throwing \r\nherself on the cyclist, she frantically kisses him on the \r\nmouth, the eyes and the nose. The rain gets heavier to the \r\nextent of blotting out the preceding scene. \r\n\r\nDissolve to the box whose diagonal stripes are superimposed \r\non those of the rain. Hands equipped with a little key open \r\nthe box, pulling out a tie wrapped in tissue paper. It must \r\nbe taken into account that the rain, the box, the tissue \r\npaper and the tie should all exhibit these diagonal stripes, \r\nwith their sizes alone varying. \r\n\r\nThe same room.\r\n\r\nStanding by the bed, the young woman is looking at the \r\nclothing articles that had been worn by the character -- \r\nruffles, box, and the stiff collar with the plain dark tie \r\n-- all laid out as though they were worn by a person lying \r\non the bed. The young woman finally decides to pick up the \r\ncollar, removing the plain tie in order to replace it with \r\nthe striped one which she has just taken out of the box. \r\nShe puts it back in the same place, and then sits down by \r\nthe bed in the posture of a person watching over the dead.\r\n\r\n(Note: The bed, that is to say, the bedspread and the \r\npillow, are slightly rumpled and depressed as if a human \r\nbody were really lying there).\r\n\r\nThe woman is aware that someone is standing behind her and \r\nturns around to see who it is. Without the least surprise, \r\nshe sees the character who now is without any of his former \r\naccessory articles, looking very attentively at something \r\nin his right hand. His great absorption betrays quite a \r\ngreat deal of anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe woman approaches and looks in turn at what he has in his \r\nhand. Close-up of the hand, the middle of which is teeming \r\nwith ants swarming out of a black hole. None of these falls \r\noff.\r\n\r\nDissolve to the armpit hair of a young woman sprawled on \r\nthe sand of a sunny beach. Dissolve to a sea urchin whose \r\nspines ripple slightly. Dissolve to the head of another \r\nyoung woman in a powerful overhead shot framed by an iris. \r\nThe iris opens to reveal the young woman surrounded by a \r\nthrong of people who are trying to break through a police \r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this circle, the young woman, holding a \r\nstick, attempts to pick up a severed hand with painted \r\nfingernails that is lying on the ground. A policeman comes \r\nup to her, sharply reprimanding her; he bends down and \r\npicks up the hand which he carefully wraps up and puts in \r\nthe box that was carried by the cyclist. He hands it all to \r\nthe young woman, saluting her in a military fashion while \r\nshe thanks him. \r\n\r\nAs the policeman hands her the box, she must appear to be \r\ncarried away by an extraordinary emotion that isolates her \r\ncompletely from everything around her. It is as though she \r\nwere enthralled by the echoes of distant religious music; \r\nperhaps music she heard in her earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nTheir curiosity satisfied, the bystanders begin to disperse \r\nin all directions.\r\n\r\nThis scene will have been seen by the characters whom we \r\nhave left in the room on the third floor. They are seen \r\nthrough the window panes of the balcony from which may be \r\nseen the end of the scene described above. When the \r\npoliceman hands the box over to the young woman, the two \r\ncharacters on the balcony appear to also be overcome to \r\nthe point of tears by the same emotion. Their heads sway \r\nas though following the rhythm of this impalpable music. \r\n\r\nThe man looks at the young woman and makes a gesture as \r\nthough he were saying: \"Did you see? Hadn\'t I told you so?\" \r\nShe looks down again at the young woman on the street who \r\nis now all alone and, as if pinned down to the spot, in a \r\nstate of utter restraint. Cars pass all around her at \r\nbreathtaking speeds. Suddenly she is run over by one of the \r\ncars and is left there horribly mutilated.\r\n\r\nIt is then that, with the decisiveness of a man fully \r\nknowing his rights, the man goes over to his companion, and, \r\nhaving gazed lasciviously straight into her eyes, he grabs \r\nher breasts through her dress. Closeup of the lustful hands \r\nover the breasts. These are bared as the dress disappears. \r\nA terrible expression of almost mortal anguish spreads over \r\nthe man\'s face, and a blood-streaked dribble runs out of \r\nhis mouth dripping on the young woman\'s bare breasts.\r\n\r\nThe breasts disappear to be transformed into thighs which \r\nthe man continues to palpate. His expression has changed. \r\nHis eyes sparkle with malice and lust. His wide open mouth \r\nnow closes down as if tightened up by a sphincter.\r\n\r\nThe young woman moves back toward the middle of the room, \r\nfollowed by the man who is still in the same posture.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she makes a forceful motion, breaking his hold on \r\nher, freeing herself from his amorous advances. \r\n\r\nThe man\'s mouth tightens with anger.\r\n\r\nShe realizes that a disagreeable or violent scene is about \r\nto take place. She moves back, step by step, until she \r\nreaches the corner of the room, where she takes up a \r\nposition behind a small table.\r\n \r\nAssuming the gestures of the melodrama villain, the man \r\nlooks around for something or other. He sees at his feet the \r\nend of a rope and picks it up with his right hand. His left \r\nhand gropes about too and gets hold of an identical rope.\r\n\r\nGlued to the wall the young woman watches with horror her \r\nattacker\'s stratagem.\r\n\r\nThe latter advances toward her dragging with great effort \r\nthat which is attached behind to the ropes.\r\n\r\nWe see passing before our eyes on the screen: first, a cork, \r\nthen a melon, then two Brothers of Christian Schools, and \r\nfinally two magnificent grand pianos. The pianos are loaded \r\nwith the rotting carcasses of two donkeys, their feet, \r\ntails, hindquarters and excrement spilling out of the \r\npiano-cases. As one of the pianos passes in front of the \r\ncamera lens, a large donkey\'s head is seen pressing the \r\nkeyboard.\r\n\r\nPulling with great difficulty this burden, the man \r\ndesperately strains toward the young woman, knocking over \r\nchairs, tables, a floor lamp, etc., etc. The donkey\'s \r\nhind-quarters get caught in everything. A lamp hanging from \r\nthe ceiling is jostled by a stripped bone, and continues \r\nrocking until the end of the scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the man is about to reach the young woman, she dodges \r\nhim with a leap and escapes. Her attacker lets go of the \r\nropes and begins pursuing her. The young woman opens a \r\ncommunicating door and vanishes into the next room, but not \r\nquickly enough to be able to lock the door behind her. The \r\nman\'s hand having made it past the joint, is held captive, \r\ncaught at the wrist.\r\n\r\nInside the other room, pressing the door harder and harder, \r\nthe young woman looks at the hand which wrenches in pain in \r\nslow motion as the ants reappear and swarm over the door.\r\n\r\nRight away, she turns her head toward the middle of the new \r\nroom, which is identical to the previous one, but on which \r\nthe lighting confers a different look; the young woman \r\nsees ...\r\n\r\nA man sprawled on the bed who is the one and the same man \r\nwhose hand is still caught in the door. Wearing the ruffles \r\nwith the box resting on his chest he does not make the \r\nleast movement but lies there, his eyes wide open, his \r\nsuperstitious expression seeming to say: \"Something really\r\nextraordinary is now about to happen!\"\r\n \r\n\r\nABOUT THREE O\'CLOCK IN THE MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\nA new character is seen from the back on the landing; he \r\nhas just stopped by the entrance door to the apartment. He \r\nrings the bell of the apartment where the events are taking \r\nplace. We don\'t see the bell nor the electric hammer, but \r\nin their place, over the door, there are two holes through \r\nwhich pass two hands shaking a silver cocktail shaker. \r\nTheir action is instantaneous, as in ordinary films when a \r\ndoorbell button is being pressed.\r\n\r\nThe man lying on the bed gives a start. \r\n\r\nThe young woman goes and opens the door.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes directly to the bed and imperiously \r\norders the man to get up. The man complies so grudgingly \r\nthat the other is obliged to grab him by the ruffles and \r\nforce him to his feet.\r\n\r\nHaving torn off the ruffles one by one, the newcomer throws \r\nthem out of the window. The box follows the same route and \r\nso do the straps which the man tries in vain to save from \r\nthe catastrophe. And this leads the newcomer to punish the \r\nman by making him go and stand with his face to one of the \r\nwalls. \r\n\r\nThe newcomer will have done all this with his back \r\ncompletely turned to the camera. He turns around now for \r\nthe first time in order to go and look for something on the \r\nother side of the room. \r\n\r\nThe sub-title says:\r\n \r\n\r\nSIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE\r\n\r\n \r\nAt this point the photography becomes hazy. The newcomer \r\nmoves in slow motion and we set that his features are \r\nidentical to those of the other; they are one and the same \r\nperson, but for the fact that the newcomer looks younger \r\nand more doleful, as the other must have been years before.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes toward the back of the room with the \r\ncamera tracking back and keeping him in medium close-up.\r\n\r\nThe school desk toward which our individual is heading \r\nenters the frame. There are two books on the school desk, \r\nas well as various school objects, whose position and moral \r\nmeaning are to be carefully determined.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer picks up the two books and turns to go and \r\njoin the other man. At this point everything goes back to \r\nnormal, the fuzziness and slow motion having disappeared.\r\n\r\nHaving come up to the man, the newcomer directs him to hold \r\nout his arms in a cruciform position, places a book in each \r\nhand, and orders him to remain so as a punishment.\r\n\r\nThe punished character\'s expression has now become keen and \r\ntreacherous. He turns to face the newcomer. The books he \r\nhas been holding turn into revolvers.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer looks at him with tenderness, an expression \r\nthat becomes more pronounced with each passing moment.\r\n\r\nThe other, threatening the newcomer with his guns and \r\nforcing him to put his hands up, does not heed the latter\'s \r\ncompliance and fires both revolvers at him. Medium close-up \r\nof the newcomer falling down fatally wounded, his features \r\ncontorted in agony (the photography\'s fuzziness is resumed \r\nand the newcomer\'s fall is in slow motion, in a way that is \r\nmore pronounced than previously).\r\n\r\nWe see in the distance the wounded man falling; this, \r\nhowever, happens no longer inside the room but in a park. \r\nSeated next to him is a motionless woman with bare \r\nshoulders, who is seen from behind leaning slightly forward. \r\nAs he falls the wounded man attempts to seize and stroke her \r\nshoulders; one of his hands is turned shaking toward \r\nhimself; the other brushes against the skin of the naked \r\nshoulders. Finally he falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nView from afar. A few passers-by and several park-keepers \r\nrush over to help. They pick him up in their arms and bear \r\nhim away through the woods.\r\n\r\nLet the passionate lame man play a role here.\r\n    \r\nAnd we are back at the same room. A door, the one in which \r\nthe hand had been caught, now opens slowly. The young woman \r\nwe already know appears. She closes the door behind her and \r\nstares very attentively at the wall against which the \r\nmurderer had stood.\r\n\r\nThe man is no longer there. The wall is bare, without any \r\nfurniture or decoration. The young woman makes a gesture of \r\nvexation and impatience.\r\n\r\nThe wall is seen again; in the middle of it there is a small \r\nblack spot. \r\n\r\nSeen much closer, this small spot appears to be a \r\ndeath\'s-head moth. \r\n\r\nClose-up of the moth.\r\n\r\nThe death\'s head on the moth\'s wings fills the whole screen. \r\n\r\nThe man who was wearing ruffles comes suddenly into view in \r\na medium shot bringing his hand swiftly to his mouth as \r\nthough he were losing his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe young woman looks at him disdainfully.\r\n    \r\nWhen the man takes away his hand, we see that his mouth has \r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe young woman seems to be saying to him: \"Well, and what \r\nnext?\" and then she touches up her lips with a lipstick.\r\n\r\nWe see again the man\'s head. Hair begins to sprout where \r\nhis mouth had been.\r\n\r\nHaving caught sight of this, the young woman stifles a cry \r\nand swiftly examines her armpit which is completely \r\ndepilated. She scornfully sticks out her tongue at him, \r\nthrows a shawl over her shoulders, and, opening the door \r\nnear her, goes into the adjacent room which is a wide \r\nbeach. \r\n\r\nA third character is waiting for her near the water\'s edge. \r\nThey greet each other very amiably, and meander together \r\ndown the waterline.\r\n \r\nA shot of their legs and the waves breaking at their feet. \r\n\r\nThe camera follows them in a dolly shot. The waves gently \r\nwash ashore at their feet, first, the straps, then the \r\nstriped box followed by the ruffles, and finally the \r\nbicycle. This shot continues a moment longer without \r\nanything else being washed ashore.\r\n\r\nThey continue their walk on the beach, little by little \r\nfading from view, while in the sky appear the words:\r\n \r\n\r\nIN THE SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything has changed.\r\n\r\nWe see now a desert without end. We see the man and the \r\nyoung woman in the center, sunk in sand up to their chests, \r\nblinded, their clothes in tatters, devoured by the sun and \r\nby swarms of insects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Shooting Script by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí \r\nTranslated by Haim Finkelstein','2016-11-29 21:38:38','2016-12-20 19:37:52','judy-kutulas-liberated-women-and-new-sensitive-men-reconstructing-gender-in-1970s-workplace-comedies','Author Interviews'),(12,'https://vimeo.com/160282780/01adcf8125','Judy Kutulas: Who Rules The Roost?: Sitcom Family Dynamics from the Cleavers to Modern Family','','PROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce Upon a Time ... \r\n\r\n\r\nA balcony at night.\r\n\r\nA man is sharpening a razor by the balcony.

These are bared as the dress disappears. \r\nA terrible expression of almost mortal anguish spreads over \r\nthe man\'s face, and a blood-streaked dribble runs out of \r\nhis mouth dripping on the young woman\'s bare breasts.\r\n\r\nThe breasts disappear to be transformed into thighs which \r\nthe man continues to palpate. His expression has changed. \r\nHis eyes sparkle with malice and lust. His wide open mouth \r\nnow closes down as if tightened up by a sphincter.\r\n\r\nThe young woman moves back toward the middle of the room, \r\nfollowed by the man who is still in the same posture.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she makes a forceful motion, breaking his hold on \r\nher, freeing herself from his amorous advances. \r\n\r\nThe man\'s mouth tightens with anger.\r\n\r\nShe realizes that a disagreeable or violent scene is about \r\nto take place. She moves back, step by step, until she \r\nreaches the corner of the room, where she takes up a \r\nposition behind a small table.\r\n \r\nAssuming the gestures of the melodrama villain, the man \r\nlooks around for something or other. He sees at his feet the \r\nend of a rope and picks it up with his right hand. His left \r\nhand gropes about too and gets hold of an identical rope.\r\n\r\nGlued to the wall the young woman watches with horror her \r\nattacker\'s stratagem.\r\n\r\nThe latter advances toward her dragging with great effort \r\nthat which is attached behind to the ropes.\r\n\r\nWe see passing before our eyes on the screen: first, a cork, \r\nthen a melon, then two Brothers of Christian Schools, and \r\nfinally two magnificent grand pianos. The pianos are loaded \r\nwith the rotting carcasses of two donkeys, their feet, \r\ntails, hindquarters and excrement spilling out of the \r\npiano-cases. As one of the pianos passes in front of the \r\ncamera lens, a large donkey\'s head is seen pressing the \r\nkeyboard.\r\n\r\nPulling with great difficulty this burden, the man \r\ndesperately strains toward the young woman, knocking over \r\nchairs, tables, a floor lamp, etc., etc. The donkey\'s \r\nhind-quarters get caught in everything. A lamp hanging from \r\nthe ceiling is jostled by a stripped bone, and continues \r\nrocking until the end of the scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the man is about to reach the young woman, she dodges \r\nhim with a leap and escapes. Her attacker lets go of the \r\nropes and begins pursuing her. The young woman opens a \r\ncommunicating door and vanishes into the next room, but not \r\nquickly enough to be able to lock the door behind her. The \r\nman\'s hand having made it past the joint, is held captive, \r\ncaught at the wrist.\r\n\r\nInside the other room, pressing the door harder and harder, \r\nthe young woman looks at the hand which wrenches in pain in \r\nslow motion as the ants reappear and swarm over the door.\r\n\r\nRight away, she turns her head toward the middle of the new \r\nroom, which is identical to the previous one, but on which \r\nthe lighting confers a different look; the young woman \r\nsees ...\r\n\r\nA man sprawled on the bed who is the one and the same man \r\nwhose hand is still caught in the door. Wearing the ruffles \r\nwith the box resting on his chest he does not make the \r\nleast movement but lies there, his eyes wide open, his \r\nsuperstitious expression seeming to say: \"Something really\r\nextraordinary is now about to happen!\"\r\n \r\n\r\nABOUT THREE O\'CLOCK IN THE MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\nA new character is seen from the back on the landing; he \r\nhas just stopped by the entrance door to the apartment. He \r\nrings the bell of the apartment where the events are taking \r\nplace. We don\'t see the bell nor the electric hammer, but \r\nin their place, over the door, there are two holes through \r\nwhich pass two hands shaking a silver cocktail shaker. \r\nTheir action is instantaneous, as in ordinary films when a \r\ndoorbell button is being pressed.\r\n\r\nThe man lying on the bed gives a start. \r\n\r\nThe young woman goes and opens the door.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes directly to the bed and imperiously \r\norders the man to get up. The man complies so grudgingly \r\nthat the other is obliged to grab him by the ruffles and \r\nforce him to his feet.\r\n\r\nHaving torn off the ruffles one by one, the newcomer throws \r\nthem out of the window. The box follows the same route and \r\nso do the straps which the man tries in vain to save from \r\nthe catastrophe. And this leads the newcomer to punish the \r\nman by making him go and stand with his face to one of the \r\nwalls. \r\n\r\nThe newcomer will have done all this with his back \r\ncompletely turned to the camera. He turns around now for \r\nthe first time in order to go and look for something on the \r\nother side of the room. \r\n\r\nThe sub-title says:\r\n \r\n\r\nSIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE\r\n\r\n \r\nAt this point the photography becomes hazy. The newcomer \r\nmoves in slow motion and we set that his features are \r\nidentical to those of the other; they are one and the same \r\nperson, but for the fact that the newcomer looks younger \r\nand more doleful, as the other must have been years before.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes toward the back of the room with the \r\ncamera tracking back and keeping him in medium close-up.\r\n\r\nThe school desk toward which our individual is heading \r\nenters the frame. There are two books on the school desk, \r\nas well as various school objects, whose position and moral \r\nmeaning are to be carefully determined.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer picks up the two books and turns to go and \r\njoin the other man. At this point everything goes back to \r\nnormal, the fuzziness and slow motion having disappeared.\r\n\r\nHaving come up to the man, the newcomer directs him to hold \r\nout his arms in a cruciform position, places a book in each \r\nhand, and orders him to remain so as a punishment.\r\n\r\nThe punished character\'s expression has now become keen and \r\ntreacherous. He turns to face the newcomer. The books he \r\nhas been holding turn into revolvers.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer looks at him with tenderness, an expression \r\nthat becomes more pronounced with each passing moment.\r\n\r\nThe other, threatening the newcomer with his guns and \r\nforcing him to put his hands up, does not heed the latter\'s \r\ncompliance and fires both revolvers at him. Medium close-up \r\nof the newcomer falling down fatally wounded, his features \r\ncontorted in agony (the photography\'s fuzziness is resumed \r\nand the newcomer\'s fall is in slow motion, in a way that is \r\nmore pronounced than previously).\r\n\r\nWe see in the distance the wounded man falling; this, \r\nhowever, happens no longer inside the room but in a park. \r\nSeated next to him is a motionless woman with bare \r\nshoulders, who is seen from behind leaning slightly forward. \r\nAs he falls the wounded man attempts to seize and stroke her \r\nshoulders; one of his hands is turned shaking toward \r\nhimself; the other brushes against the skin of the naked \r\nshoulders. Finally he falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nView from afar. A few passers-by and several park-keepers \r\nrush over to help. They pick him up in their arms and bear \r\nhim away through the woods.\r\n\r\nLet the passionate lame man play a role here.\r\n    \r\nAnd we are back at the same room. A door, the one in which \r\nthe hand had been caught, now opens slowly. The young woman \r\nwe already know appears. She closes the door behind her and \r\nstares very attentively at the wall against which the \r\nmurderer had stood.\r\n\r\nThe man is no longer there. The wall is bare, without any \r\nfurniture or decoration. The young woman makes a gesture of \r\nvexation and impatience.\r\n\r\nThe wall is seen again; in the middle of it there is a small \r\nblack spot. \r\n\r\nSeen much closer, this small spot appears to be a \r\ndeath\'s-head moth. \r\n\r\nClose-up of the moth.\r\n\r\nThe death\'s head on the moth\'s wings fills the whole screen. \r\n\r\nThe man who was wearing ruffles comes suddenly into view in \r\na medium shot bringing his hand swiftly to his mouth as \r\nthough he were losing his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe young woman looks at him disdainfully.\r\n    \r\nWhen the man takes away his hand, we see that his mouth has \r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe young woman seems to be saying to him: \"Well, and what \r\nnext?\" and then she touches up her lips with a lipstick.\r\n\r\nWe see again the man\'s head. Hair begins to sprout where \r\nhis mouth had been.\r\n\r\nHaving caught sight of this, the young woman stifles a cry \r\nand swiftly examines her armpit which is completely \r\ndepilated. She scornfully sticks out her tongue at him, \r\nthrows a shawl over her shoulders, and, opening the door \r\nnear her, goes into the adjacent room which is a wide \r\nbeach. \r\n\r\nA third character is waiting for her near the water\'s edge. \r\nThey greet each other very amiably, and meander together \r\ndown the waterline.\r\n \r\nA shot of their legs and the waves breaking at their feet. \r\n\r\nThe camera follows them in a dolly shot. The waves gently \r\nwash ashore at their feet, first, the straps, then the \r\nstriped box followed by the ruffles, and finally the \r\nbicycle. This shot continues a moment longer without \r\nanything else being washed ashore.\r\n\r\nThey continue their walk on the beach, little by little \r\nfading from view, while in the sky appear the words:\r\n \r\n\r\nIN THE SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything has changed.\r\n\r\nWe see now a desert without end. We see the man and the \r\nyoung woman in the center, sunk in sand up to their chests, \r\nblinded, their clothes in tatters, devoured by the sun and \r\nby swarms of insects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Shooting Script by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí \r\nTranslated by Haim Finkelstein','2016-11-29 21:40:29','2016-12-20 19:38:40','judy-kutulas-who-rules-the-roost-sitcom-family-dynamics-from-the-cleavers-to-modern-family','Author Interviews'),(13,'https://vimeo.com/163469316/42d717cd10','James Schultz: Disability and Sitcoms: A “Legit” Analysis','','PROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce Upon a Time ... \r\n\r\n\r\nA balcony at night.\r\n\r\nA man is sharpening a razor by the balcony. The man looks \r\nat the sky through the window-panes and sees ... \r\n\r\nA light cloud moving toward the full moon.\r\n\r\nThen a young woman\'s head, her eyes wide open. A razor blade \r\nmoves toward one of the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe light cloud passes now across the moon.\r\n \r\nThe razor blade cuts through the eye of the young woman, \r\nslicing it.\r\n\r\n				End of Prologue.\r\n \r\n\r\nEIGHT YEARS LATER\r\n\r\n\r\nA deserted street. It is raining.\r\n\r\nA character dressed in a dark-gray suit appears riding a \r\nbicycle. His head, back and loins are adorned in ruffles of \r\nwhite linen. A rectangular box with black and white diagonal \r\nstripes is secured to his chest by straps. The character \r\npedals mechanically without holding the handlebars, with his \r\nhands resting on his knees. \r\n\r\nThe character is seen from the back down to the thighs in a \r\nmedium shot, superimposed lengthwise on the street down \r\nwhich he is cycling with his back to the camera.\r\n\r\nThe character moves toward the camera until the striped box \r\nis seen in a close-up.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary room on the third floor on the same street. A \r\nyoung girl wearing a brightly colored dress is sitting in \r\nthe middle of the room attentively reading a book. Suddenly \r\nshe comes out of her reading with a start, listens with \r\ncuriosity, freeing herself of the book by throwing it on a \r\nnearby couch. The book stays open with a reproduction of \r\nVermeer\'s The Lacemaker on one of the pages facing \r\nup. The young woman is convinced now that something is in \r\nthe offing: she, gets up, and, half turning, walks in quick \r\nsteps toward the window. \r\n\r\nThe character we have mentioned before has just at this very \r\nmoment stopped, below on the street. Without offering the \r\nleast resistance, out of inertia, he lets himself come down \r\nwith the bicycle into the gutter, in the midst of a mud \r\nheap.\r\n\r\nLooking enraged and resentful, the young woman hurries down \r\nthe stairs and out to the street.\r\n\r\nClose-up of the character sprawling on the ground, \r\nexpressionless, his position identical to that at the \r\nmoment of his fall.\r\n\r\nThe young woman comes out of the house, and, throwing \r\nherself on the cyclist, she frantically kisses him on the \r\nmouth, the eyes and the nose. The rain gets heavier to the \r\nextent of blotting out the preceding scene. \r\n\r\nDissolve to the box whose diagonal stripes are superimposed \r\non those of the rain. Hands equipped with a little key open \r\nthe box, pulling out a tie wrapped in tissue paper. It must \r\nbe taken into account that the rain, the box, the tissue \r\npaper and the tie should all exhibit these diagonal stripes, \r\nwith their sizes alone varying. \r\n\r\nThe same room.\r\n\r\nStanding by the bed, the young woman is looking at the \r\nclothing articles that had been worn by the character -- \r\nruffles, box, and the stiff collar with the plain dark tie \r\n-- all laid out as though they were worn by a person lying \r\non the bed. The young woman finally decides to pick up the \r\ncollar, removing the plain tie in order to replace it with \r\nthe striped one which she has just taken out of the box. \r\nShe puts it back in the same place, and then sits down by \r\nthe bed in the posture of a person watching over the dead.\r\n\r\n(Note: The bed, that is to say, the bedspread and the \r\npillow, are slightly rumpled and depressed as if a human \r\nbody were really lying there).\r\n\r\nThe woman is aware that someone is standing behind her and \r\nturns around to see who it is. Without the least surprise, \r\nshe sees the character who now is without any of his former \r\naccessory articles, looking very attentively at something \r\nin his right hand. His great absorption betrays quite a \r\ngreat deal of anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe woman approaches and looks in turn at what he has in his \r\nhand. Close-up of the hand, the middle of which is teeming \r\nwith ants swarming out of a black hole. None of these falls \r\noff.\r\n\r\nDissolve to the armpit hair of a young woman sprawled on \r\nthe sand of a sunny beach. Dissolve to a sea urchin whose \r\nspines ripple slightly. Dissolve to the head of another \r\nyoung woman in a powerful overhead shot framed by an iris. \r\nThe iris opens to reveal the young woman surrounded by a \r\nthrong of people who are trying to break through a police \r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this circle, the young woman, holding a \r\nstick, attempts to pick up a severed hand with painted \r\nfingernails that is lying on the ground. A policeman comes \r\nup to her, sharply reprimanding her; he bends down and \r\npicks up the hand which he carefully wraps up and puts in \r\nthe box that was carried by the cyclist. He hands it all to \r\nthe young woman, saluting her in a military fashion while \r\nshe thanks him. \r\n\r\nAs the policeman hands her the box, she must appear to be \r\ncarried away by an extraordinary emotion that isolates her \r\ncompletely from everything around her. It is as though she \r\nwere enthralled by the echoes of distant religious music; \r\nperhaps music she heard in her earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nTheir curiosity satisfied, the bystanders begin to disperse \r\nin all directions.\r\n\r\nThis scene will have been seen by the characters whom we \r\nhave left in the room on the third floor. They are seen \r\nthrough the window panes of the balcony from which may be \r\nseen the end of the scene described above. When the \r\npoliceman hands the box over to the young woman, the two \r\ncharacters on the balcony appear to also be overcome to \r\nthe point of tears by the same emotion. Their heads sway \r\nas though following the rhythm of this impalpable music. \r\n\r\nThe man looks at the young woman and makes a gesture as \r\nthough he were saying: \"Did you see? Hadn\'t I told you so?\" \r\nShe looks down again at the young woman on the street who \r\nis now all alone and, as if pinned down to the spot, in a \r\nstate of utter restraint. Cars pass all around her at \r\nbreathtaking speeds. Suddenly she is run over by one of the \r\ncars and is left there horribly mutilated.\r\n\r\nIt is then that, with the decisiveness of a man fully \r\nknowing his rights, the man goes over to his companion, and, \r\nhaving gazed lasciviously straight into her eyes, he grabs \r\nher breasts through her dress. Closeup of the lustful hands \r\nover the breasts. These are bared as the dress disappears. \r\nA terrible expression of almost mortal anguish spreads over \r\nthe man\'s face, and a blood-streaked dribble runs out of \r\nhis mouth dripping on the young woman\'s bare breasts.\r\n\r\nThe breasts disappear to be transformed into thighs which \r\nthe man continues to palpate. His expression has changed. \r\nHis eyes sparkle with malice and lust. His wide open mouth \r\nnow closes down as if tightened up by a sphincter.\r\n\r\nThe young woman moves back toward the middle of the room, \r\nfollowed by the man who is still in the same posture.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she makes a forceful motion, breaking his hold on \r\nher, freeing herself from his amorous advances. \r\n\r\nThe man\'s mouth tightens with anger.\r\n\r\nShe realizes that a disagreeable or violent scene is about \r\nto take place. She moves back, step by step, until she \r\nreaches the corner of the room, where she takes up a \r\nposition behind a small table.\r\n \r\nAssuming the gestures of the melodrama villain, the man \r\nlooks around for something or other. He sees at his feet the \r\nend of a rope and picks it up with his right hand. His left \r\nhand gropes about too and gets hold of an identical rope.\r\n\r\nGlued to the wall the young woman watches with horror her \r\nattacker\'s stratagem.\r\n\r\nThe latter advances toward her dragging with great effort \r\nthat which is attached behind to the ropes.\r\n\r\nWe see passing before our eyes on the screen: first, a cork, \r\nthen a melon, then two Brothers of Christian Schools, and \r\nfinally two magnificent grand pianos. The pianos are loaded \r\nwith the rotting carcasses of two donkeys, their feet, \r\ntails, hindquarters and excrement spilling out of the \r\npiano-cases. As one of the pianos passes in front of the \r\ncamera lens, a large donkey\'s head is seen pressing the \r\nkeyboard.\r\n\r\nPulling with great difficulty this burden, the man \r\ndesperately strains toward the young woman, knocking over \r\nchairs, tables, a floor lamp, etc., etc. The donkey\'s \r\nhind-quarters get caught in everything. A lamp hanging from \r\nthe ceiling is jostled by a stripped bone, and continues \r\nrocking until the end of the scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the man is about to reach the young woman, she dodges \r\nhim with a leap and escapes. Her attacker lets go of the \r\nropes and begins pursuing her. The young woman opens a \r\ncommunicating door and vanishes into the next room, but not \r\nquickly enough to be able to lock the door behind her. The \r\nman\'s hand having made it past the joint, is held captive, \r\ncaught at the wrist.\r\n\r\nInside the other room, pressing the door harder and harder, \r\nthe young woman looks at the hand which wrenches in pain in \r\nslow motion as the ants reappear and swarm over the door.\r\n\r\nRight away, she turns her head toward the middle of the new \r\nroom, which is identical to the previous one, but on which \r\nthe lighting confers a different look; the young woman \r\nsees ...\r\n\r\nA man sprawled on the bed who is the one and the same man \r\nwhose hand is still caught in the door. Wearing the ruffles \r\nwith the box resting on his chest he does not make the \r\nleast movement but lies there, his eyes wide open, his \r\nsuperstitious expression seeming to say: \"Something really\r\nextraordinary is now about to happen!\"\r\n \r\n\r\nABOUT THREE O\'CLOCK IN THE MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\nA new character is seen from the back on the landing; he \r\nhas just stopped by the entrance door to the apartment. He \r\nrings the bell of the apartment where the events are taking \r\nplace. We don\'t see the bell nor the electric hammer, but \r\nin their place, over the door, there are two holes through \r\nwhich pass two hands shaking a silver cocktail shaker. \r\nTheir action is instantaneous, as in ordinary films when a \r\ndoorbell button is being pressed.\r\n\r\nThe man lying on the bed gives a start. \r\n\r\nThe young woman goes and opens the door.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes directly to the bed and imperiously \r\norders the man to get up. The man complies so grudgingly \r\nthat the other is obliged to grab him by the ruffles and \r\nforce him to his feet.\r\n\r\nHaving torn off the ruffles one by one, the newcomer throws \r\nthem out of the window. The box follows the same route and \r\nso do the straps which the man tries in vain to save from \r\nthe catastrophe. And this leads the newcomer to punish the \r\nman by making him go and stand with his face to one of the \r\nwalls. \r\n\r\nThe newcomer will have done all this with his back \r\ncompletely turned to the camera. He turns around now for \r\nthe first time in order to go and look for something on the \r\nother side of the room. \r\n\r\nThe sub-title says:\r\n \r\n\r\nSIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE\r\n\r\n \r\nAt this point the photography becomes hazy. The newcomer \r\nmoves in slow motion and we set that his features are \r\nidentical to those of the other; they are one and the same \r\nperson, but for the fact that the newcomer looks younger \r\nand more doleful, as the other must have been years before.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes toward the back of the room with the \r\ncamera tracking back and keeping him in medium close-up.\r\n\r\nThe school desk toward which our individual is heading \r\nenters the frame. There are two books on the school desk, \r\nas well as various school objects, whose position and moral \r\nmeaning are to be carefully determined.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer picks up the two books and turns to go and \r\njoin the other man. At this point everything goes back to \r\nnormal, the fuzziness and slow motion having disappeared.\r\n\r\nHaving come up to the man, the newcomer directs him to hold \r\nout his arms in a cruciform position, places a book in each \r\nhand, and orders him to remain so as a punishment.\r\n\r\nThe punished character\'s expression has now become keen and \r\ntreacherous. He turns to face the newcomer. The books he \r\nhas been holding turn into revolvers.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer looks at him with tenderness, an expression \r\nthat becomes more pronounced with each passing moment.\r\n\r\nThe other, threatening the newcomer with his guns and \r\nforcing him to put his hands up, does not heed the latter\'s \r\ncompliance and fires both revolvers at him. Medium close-up \r\nof the newcomer falling down fatally wounded, his features \r\ncontorted in agony (the photography\'s fuzziness is resumed \r\nand the newcomer\'s fall is in slow motion, in a way that is \r\nmore pronounced than previously).\r\n\r\nWe see in the distance the wounded man falling; this, \r\nhowever, happens no longer inside the room but in a park. \r\nSeated next to him is a motionless woman with bare \r\nshoulders, who is seen from behind leaning slightly forward. \r\nAs he falls the wounded man attempts to seize and stroke her \r\nshoulders; one of his hands is turned shaking toward \r\nhimself; the other brushes against the skin of the naked \r\nshoulders. Finally he falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nView from afar. A few passers-by and several park-keepers \r\nrush over to help. They pick him up in their arms and bear \r\nhim away through the woods.\r\n\r\nLet the passionate lame man play a role here.\r\n    \r\nAnd we are back at the same room. A door, the one in which \r\nthe hand had been caught, now opens slowly. The young woman \r\nwe already know appears. She closes the door behind her and \r\nstares very attentively at the wall against which the \r\nmurderer had stood.\r\n\r\nThe man is no longer there. The wall is bare, without any \r\nfurniture or decoration. The young woman makes a gesture of \r\nvexation and impatience.\r\n\r\nThe wall is seen again; in the middle of it there is a small \r\nblack spot. \r\n\r\nSeen much closer, this small spot appears to be a \r\ndeath\'s-head moth. \r\n\r\nClose-up of the moth.\r\n\r\nThe death\'s head on the moth\'s wings fills the whole screen. \r\n\r\nThe man who was wearing ruffles comes suddenly into view in \r\na medium shot bringing his hand swiftly to his mouth as \r\nthough he were losing his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe young woman looks at him disdainfully.\r\n    \r\nWhen the man takes away his hand, we see that his mouth has \r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe young woman seems to be saying to him: \"Well, and what \r\nnext?\" and then she touches up her lips with a lipstick.\r\n\r\nWe see again the man\'s head. Hair begins to sprout where \r\nhis mouth had been.\r\n\r\nHaving caught sight of this, the young woman stifles a cry \r\nand swiftly examines her armpit which is completely \r\ndepilated. She scornfully sticks out her tongue at him, \r\nthrows a shawl over her shoulders, and, opening the door \r\nnear her, goes into the adjacent room which is a wide \r\nbeach. \r\n\r\nA third character is waiting for her near the water\'s edge. \r\nThey greet each other very amiably, and meander together \r\ndown the waterline.\r\n \r\nA shot of their legs and the waves breaking at their feet. \r\n\r\nThe camera follows them in a dolly shot. The waves gently \r\nwash ashore at their feet, first, the straps, then the \r\nstriped box followed by the ruffles, and finally the \r\nbicycle. This shot continues a moment longer without \r\nanything else being washed ashore.\r\n\r\nThey continue their walk on the beach, little by little \r\nfading from view, while in the sky appear the words:\r\n \r\n\r\nIN THE SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything has changed.\r\n\r\nWe see now a desert without end. We see the man and the \r\nyoung woman in the center, sunk in sand up to their chests, \r\nblinded, their clothes in tatters, devoured by the sun and \r\nby swarms of insects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Shooting Script by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí \r\nTranslated by Haim Finkelstein','2016-11-29 21:42:29','2016-12-20 19:37:38','james-schultz-disability-and-sitcoms-a-legit-analysis','Author Interviews'),(14,'https://vimeo.com/162582317/540a9423c9','Susan McLeland: Roseanne, Rossanne, Reality, and Domestic Comedy','','PROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce Upon a Time ... \r\n\r\n\r\nA balcony at night.\r\n\r\nA man is sharpening a razor by the balcony.

A razor blade \r\nmoves toward one of the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe light cloud passes now across the moon.\r\n \r\nThe razor blade cuts through the eye of the young woman, \r\nslicing it.\r\n\r\n				End of Prologue.\r\n \r\n\r\nEIGHT YEARS LATER\r\n\r\n\r\nA deserted street. It is raining.\r\n\r\nA character dressed in a dark-gray suit appears riding a \r\nbicycle. His head, back and loins are adorned in ruffles of \r\nwhite linen. A rectangular box with black and white diagonal \r\nstripes is secured to his chest by straps. The character \r\npedals mechanically without holding the handlebars, with his \r\nhands resting on his knees. \r\n\r\nThe character is seen from the back down to the thighs in a \r\nmedium shot, superimposed lengthwise on the street down \r\nwhich he is cycling with his back to the camera.\r\n\r\nThe character moves toward the camera until the striped box \r\nis seen in a close-up.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary room on the third floor on the same street. A \r\nyoung girl wearing a brightly colored dress is sitting in \r\nthe middle of the room attentively reading a book. Suddenly \r\nshe comes out of her reading with a start, listens with \r\ncuriosity, freeing herself of the book by throwing it on a \r\nnearby couch. The book stays open with a reproduction of \r\nVermeer\'s The Lacemaker on one of the pages facing \r\nup. The young woman is convinced now that something is in \r\nthe offing: she, gets up, and, half turning, walks in quick \r\nsteps toward the window. \r\n\r\nThe character we have mentioned before has just at this very \r\nmoment stopped, below on the street. Without offering the \r\nleast resistance, out of inertia, he lets himself come down \r\nwith the bicycle into the gutter, in the midst of a mud \r\nheap.\r\n\r\nLooking enraged and resentful, the young woman hurries down \r\nthe stairs and out to the street.\r\n\r\nClose-up of the character sprawling on the ground, \r\nexpressionless, his position identical to that at the \r\nmoment of his fall.\r\n\r\nThe young woman comes out of the house, and, throwing \r\nherself on the cyclist, she frantically kisses him on the \r\nmouth, the eyes and the nose. The rain gets heavier to the \r\nextent of blotting out the preceding scene. \r\n\r\nDissolve to the box whose diagonal stripes are superimposed \r\non those of the rain. Hands equipped with a little key open \r\nthe box, pulling out a tie wrapped in tissue paper. It must \r\nbe taken into account that the rain, the box, the tissue \r\npaper and the tie should all exhibit these diagonal stripes, \r\nwith their sizes alone varying. \r\n\r\nThe same room.\r\n\r\nStanding by the bed, the young woman is looking at the \r\nclothing articles that had been worn by the character -- \r\nruffles, box, and the stiff collar with the plain dark tie \r\n-- all laid out as though they were worn by a person lying \r\non the bed. The young woman finally decides to pick up the \r\ncollar, removing the plain tie in order to replace it with \r\nthe striped one which she has just taken out of the box. \r\nShe puts it back in the same place, and then sits down by \r\nthe bed in the posture of a person watching over the dead.\r\n\r\n(Note: The bed, that is to say, the bedspread and the \r\npillow, are slightly rumpled and depressed as if a human \r\nbody were really lying there).\r\n\r\nThe woman is aware that someone is standing behind her and \r\nturns around to see who it is. Without the least surprise, \r\nshe sees the character who now is without any of his former \r\naccessory articles, looking very attentively at something \r\nin his right hand. His great absorption betrays quite a \r\ngreat deal of anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe woman approaches and looks in turn at what he has in his \r\nhand. Close-up of the hand, the middle of which is teeming \r\nwith ants swarming out of a black hole. None of these falls \r\noff.\r\n\r\nDissolve to the armpit hair of a young woman sprawled on \r\nthe sand of a sunny beach. Dissolve to a sea urchin whose \r\nspines ripple slightly. Dissolve to the head of another \r\nyoung woman in a powerful overhead shot framed by an iris. \r\nThe iris opens to reveal the young woman surrounded by a \r\nthrong of people who are trying to break through a police \r\nbarrier.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this circle, the young woman, holding a \r\nstick, attempts to pick up a severed hand with painted \r\nfingernails that is lying on the ground. A policeman comes \r\nup to her, sharply reprimanding her; he bends down and \r\npicks up the hand which he carefully wraps up and puts in \r\nthe box that was carried by the cyclist. He hands it all to \r\nthe young woman, saluting her in a military fashion while \r\nshe thanks him. \r\n\r\nAs the policeman hands her the box, she must appear to be \r\ncarried away by an extraordinary emotion that isolates her \r\ncompletely from everything around her. It is as though she \r\nwere enthralled by the echoes of distant religious music; \r\nperhaps music she heard in her earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nTheir curiosity satisfied, the bystanders begin to disperse \r\nin all directions.\r\n\r\nThis scene will have been seen by the characters whom we \r\nhave left in the room on the third floor. They are seen \r\nthrough the window panes of the balcony from which may be \r\nseen the end of the scene described above. When the \r\npoliceman hands the box over to the young woman, the two \r\ncharacters on the balcony appear to also be overcome to \r\nthe point of tears by the same emotion. Their heads sway \r\nas though following the rhythm of this impalpable music. \r\n\r\nThe man looks at the young woman and makes a gesture as \r\nthough he were saying: \"Did you see? Hadn\'t I told you so?\" \r\nShe looks down again at the young woman on the street who \r\nis now all alone and, as if pinned down to the spot, in a \r\nstate of utter restraint. Cars pass all around her at \r\nbreathtaking speeds. Suddenly she is run over by one of the \r\ncars and is left there horribly mutilated.\r\n\r\nIt is then that, with the decisiveness of a man fully \r\nknowing his rights, the man goes over to his companion, and, \r\nhaving gazed lasciviously straight into her eyes, he grabs \r\nher breasts through her dress. Closeup of the lustful hands \r\nover the breasts. These are bared as the dress disappears. \r\nA terrible expression of almost mortal anguish spreads over \r\nthe man\'s face, and a blood-streaked dribble runs out of \r\nhis mouth dripping on the young woman\'s bare breasts.\r\n\r\nThe breasts disappear to be transformed into thighs which \r\nthe man continues to palpate. His expression has changed. \r\nHis eyes sparkle with malice and lust. His wide open mouth \r\nnow closes down as if tightened up by a sphincter.\r\n\r\nThe young woman moves back toward the middle of the room, \r\nfollowed by the man who is still in the same posture.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she makes a forceful motion, breaking his hold on \r\nher, freeing herself from his amorous advances. \r\n\r\nThe man\'s mouth tightens with anger.\r\n\r\nShe realizes that a disagreeable or violent scene is about \r\nto take place. She moves back, step by step, until she \r\nreaches the corner of the room, where she takes up a \r\nposition behind a small table.\r\n \r\nAssuming the gestures of the melodrama villain, the man \r\nlooks around for something or other. He sees at his feet the \r\nend of a rope and picks it up with his right hand. His left \r\nhand gropes about too and gets hold of an identical rope.\r\n\r\nGlued to the wall the young woman watches with horror her \r\nattacker\'s stratagem.\r\n\r\nThe latter advances toward her dragging with great effort \r\nthat which is attached behind to the ropes.\r\n\r\nWe see passing before our eyes on the screen: first, a cork, \r\nthen a melon, then two Brothers of Christian Schools, and \r\nfinally two magnificent grand pianos. The pianos are loaded \r\nwith the rotting carcasses of two donkeys, their feet, \r\ntails, hindquarters and excrement spilling out of the \r\npiano-cases. As one of the pianos passes in front of the \r\ncamera lens, a large donkey\'s head is seen pressing the \r\nkeyboard.\r\n\r\nPulling with great difficulty this burden, the man \r\ndesperately strains toward the young woman, knocking over \r\nchairs, tables, a floor lamp, etc., etc. The donkey\'s \r\nhind-quarters get caught in everything. A lamp hanging from \r\nthe ceiling is jostled by a stripped bone, and continues \r\nrocking until the end of the scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the man is about to reach the young woman, she dodges \r\nhim with a leap and escapes. Her attacker lets go of the \r\nropes and begins pursuing her. The young woman opens a \r\ncommunicating door and vanishes into the next room, but not \r\nquickly enough to be able to lock the door behind her. The \r\nman\'s hand having made it past the joint, is held captive, \r\ncaught at the wrist.\r\n\r\nInside the other room, pressing the door harder and harder, \r\nthe young woman looks at the hand which wrenches in pain in \r\nslow motion as the ants reappear and swarm over the door.\r\n\r\nRight away, she turns her head toward the middle of the new \r\nroom, which is identical to the previous one, but on which \r\nthe lighting confers a different look; the young woman \r\nsees ...\r\n\r\nA man sprawled on the bed who is the one and the same man \r\nwhose hand is still caught in the door. Wearing the ruffles \r\nwith the box resting on his chest he does not make the \r\nleast movement but lies there, his eyes wide open, his \r\nsuperstitious expression seeming to say: \"Something really\r\nextraordinary is now about to happen!\"\r\n \r\n\r\nABOUT THREE O\'CLOCK IN THE MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\nA new character is seen from the back on the landing; he \r\nhas just stopped by the entrance door to the apartment. He \r\nrings the bell of the apartment where the events are taking \r\nplace. We don\'t see the bell nor the electric hammer, but \r\nin their place, over the door, there are two holes through \r\nwhich pass two hands shaking a silver cocktail shaker. \r\nTheir action is instantaneous, as in ordinary films when a \r\ndoorbell button is being pressed.\r\n\r\nThe man lying on the bed gives a start. \r\n\r\nThe young woman goes and opens the door.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes directly to the bed and imperiously \r\norders the man to get up. The man complies so grudgingly \r\nthat the other is obliged to grab him by the ruffles and \r\nforce him to his feet.\r\n\r\nHaving torn off the ruffles one by one, the newcomer throws \r\nthem out of the window. The box follows the same route and \r\nso do the straps which the man tries in vain to save from \r\nthe catastrophe. And this leads the newcomer to punish the \r\nman by making him go and stand with his face to one of the \r\nwalls. \r\n\r\nThe newcomer will have done all this with his back \r\ncompletely turned to the camera. He turns around now for \r\nthe first time in order to go and look for something on the \r\nother side of the room. \r\n\r\nThe sub-title says:\r\n \r\n\r\nSIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE\r\n\r\n \r\nAt this point the photography becomes hazy. The newcomer \r\nmoves in slow motion and we set that his features are \r\nidentical to those of the other; they are one and the same \r\nperson, but for the fact that the newcomer looks younger \r\nand more doleful, as the other must have been years before.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer goes toward the back of the room with the \r\ncamera tracking back and keeping him in medium close-up.\r\n\r\nThe school desk toward which our individual is heading \r\nenters the frame. There are two books on the school desk, \r\nas well as various school objects, whose position and moral \r\nmeaning are to be carefully determined.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer picks up the two books and turns to go and \r\njoin the other man. At this point everything goes back to \r\nnormal, the fuzziness and slow motion having disappeared.\r\n\r\nHaving come up to the man, the newcomer directs him to hold \r\nout his arms in a cruciform position, places a book in each \r\nhand, and orders him to remain so as a punishment.\r\n\r\nThe punished character\'s expression has now become keen and \r\ntreacherous. He turns to face the newcomer. The books he \r\nhas been holding turn into revolvers.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer looks at him with tenderness, an expression \r\nthat becomes more pronounced with each passing moment.\r\n\r\nThe other, threatening the newcomer with his guns and \r\nforcing him to put his hands up, does not heed the latter\'s \r\ncompliance and fires both revolvers at him. Medium close-up \r\nof the newcomer falling down fatally wounded, his features \r\ncontorted in agony (the photography\'s fuzziness is resumed \r\nand the newcomer\'s fall is in slow motion, in a way that is \r\nmore pronounced than previously).\r\n\r\nWe see in the distance the wounded man falling; this, \r\nhowever, happens no longer inside the room but in a park. \r\nSeated next to him is a motionless woman with bare \r\nshoulders, who is seen from behind leaning slightly forward. \r\nAs he falls the wounded man attempts to seize and stroke her \r\nshoulders; one of his hands is turned shaking toward \r\nhimself; the other brushes against the skin of the naked \r\nshoulders. Finally he falls to the ground.\r\n\r\nView from afar. A few passers-by and several park-keepers \r\nrush over to help. They pick him up in their arms and bear \r\nhim away through the woods.\r\n\r\nLet the passionate lame man play a role here.\r\n    \r\nAnd we are back at the same room. A door, the one in which \r\nthe hand had been caught, now opens slowly. The young woman \r\nwe already know appears. She closes the door behind her and \r\nstares very attentively at the wall against which the \r\nmurderer had stood.\r\n\r\nThe man is no longer there. The wall is bare, without any \r\nfurniture or decoration. The young woman makes a gesture of \r\nvexation and impatience.\r\n\r\nThe wall is seen again; in the middle of it there is a small \r\nblack spot. \r\n\r\nSeen much closer, this small spot appears to be a \r\ndeath\'s-head moth. \r\n\r\nClose-up of the moth.\r\n\r\nThe death\'s head on the moth\'s wings fills the whole screen. \r\n\r\nThe man who was wearing ruffles comes suddenly into view in \r\na medium shot bringing his hand swiftly to his mouth as \r\nthough he were losing his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe young woman looks at him disdainfully.\r\n    \r\nWhen the man takes away his hand, we see that his mouth has \r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe young woman seems to be saying to him: \"Well, and what \r\nnext?\" and then she touches up her lips with a lipstick.\r\n\r\nWe see again the man\'s head. Hair begins to sprout where \r\nhis mouth had been.\r\n\r\nHaving caught sight of this, the young woman stifles a cry \r\nand swiftly examines her armpit which is completely \r\ndepilated. She scornfully sticks out her tongue at him, \r\nthrows a shawl over her shoulders, and, opening the door \r\nnear her, goes into the adjacent room which is a wide \r\nbeach. \r\n\r\nA third character is waiting for her near the water\'s edge. \r\nThey greet each other very amiably, and meander together \r\ndown the waterline.\r\n \r\nA shot of their legs and the waves breaking at their feet. \r\n\r\nThe camera follows them in a dolly shot. The waves gently \r\nwash ashore at their feet, first, the straps, then the \r\nstriped box followed by the ruffles, and finally the \r\nbicycle. This shot continues a moment longer without \r\nanything else being washed ashore.\r\n\r\nThey continue their walk on the beach, little by little \r\nfading from view, while in the sky appear the words:\r\n \r\n\r\nIN THE SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything has changed.\r\n\r\nWe see now a desert without end.
