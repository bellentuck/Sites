    <h3>A Message from Mary M. Dalton</h3>
    <p>
      Along with Laura R. Linder, I am co-editor of <i>The Sitcom Reader: America Re-viewed, Still Skewed</i>.  When I decided to build my undergraduate seminar Culture and the Sitcom around the book and to develop an online version of the course, I decided to interview contributors to the anthology to make the class come alive in a new way for my students.
